# learn-bevy

This repo contains the code from following along a bevy (a rust game engine) tutorial.

Thanks to https://www.youtube.com/@jacques-dev for making a great tutorial!

A link to the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQt-v_bFdao&list=PLVnntJRoP85JHGX7rGDu6LaF3fmDDbqyd&pp=0gcJCWMEOCosWNin

Note that the tutorial uses bevy v0.10, but I've used the newest version that was available at the point of following along the tutorial, which is v0.16, so some code was adapted to reflect the breaking changes.
